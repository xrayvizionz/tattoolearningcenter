# U.S. Tattoo Regulations Directory

This page links to official state sources for tattoo licensing, body art regulations, and health department guidance.


> **Important note on local regulations:**  
> Tattooing and body art are regulated differently across the United States.  
> Some states issue licenses at the state level, while others delegate authority to **county or city health departments**.  
> In those cases, you may need to check **local regulations in addition to state rules**.  
> Always confirm requirements with the official agency linked for your jurisdiction.


> **Disclaimer:** TattooLearningCenter.org provides links for educational convenience only. We are not a government agency and do not provide legal advice. Regulations change—always confirm with the official source.
