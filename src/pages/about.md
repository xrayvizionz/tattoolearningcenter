# About Tattoo Learning Center

Tattoo Learning Center is a free educational resource built to help artists, apprentices, and educators find reliable information, training tools, and hard-to-find opportunities.

## What you’ll find here

- **Regulations directory:** links to official state and local sources for tattoo and body art laws and licensing regulations
- **Practice & tools:** learning resources, supply checklists, and skill-building guidance
- **Training & cohorts:** workshops, apprenticeships, and structured training opportunities (as we find them)

## What this site is not

- Not a government agency  
- Not legal advice  
- Not a licensing authority  
- Not a marketplace or paid placement directory

We aim to link to **official sources** wherever possible and keep information organized and easy to verify.

## How to use the regulations directory

Regulations can vary widely. Some states regulate tattooing at the state level, while others delegate authority to counties or cities.

Always confirm:
- requirements for your **specific jurisdiction**
- the **most recent** rules and updates
- whether additional local permits apply

## Suggest a resource or correction

If you find a broken link, an updated official source, or a training opportunity we should include, please reach out.
